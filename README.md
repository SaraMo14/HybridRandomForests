## Hybrid Random Forests: a new approach to image classification

### Abstract: 
In recent years, the number of digital images has grown enormously, introducing new challenges in Image Classification that had not emerged for smaller datasets. In particular, the management of ever-increasing datasets, in which not only the amount of training images but also the number of classes grows over time, is a hitherto under-explored situation. In this thesis, the variant of the standard Random Forest proposed combines generative and discriminative nodes in order to overcome this problem. This new approach allows the integration of data from new classes in a way that extends the previously constructed forest, rather than training it again from scratch. The experiments conducted show that this classifier achieves encouraging results compared to the state of the art, offering, in addition, the possibility of incremental learning.
